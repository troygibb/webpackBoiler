# Webpack Boiler

## Install and Run

Clone to your local machine, and from the root in the command line run: 

```
npm install
```

Check to make sure the build process works for webpack (which you should have installed globally), and run:

```
npm run build
```

Based on your specific dev environment, you may have to install some dependencies globally. If any errors pop up related to this issue, do as they instruct and install the respective dependencies. 

If no other errors pop up, run: 

```
npm start
```

This command will spin up your local server on port 3000, and enable hot module replacement. Check out the app in your browser [http://localhost:3000/] and confirm that the background is blue, and that the 'hello world' example is working.
